\paragraph{Whom we are?} 
%Electric signals are involved in everything you do: eat, drink, move, think, sleep, see, talk and so on. Neurons use them to communicate with each other or to trigger muscle contraction, and are important for maintaining your body's ``status quo'' So, every time you eat something, food is broken down, absorbed by your GI-tract and distributed throughout your body. This food uptake is not possible without electric signals. The proteins that create such signals are called ion channels. They form pores in cell membranes that selectively allow ions (e.g. Na+, Cl-, K+) to pass across the membrane. When these charged ions cross the membrane through ion channels, a small electric signal is created. For example, the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) mediates salt taste, while matching your salt intake with its excretion rate through your kidneys.

"CytoTransport" is a research cluster at H-BRS that was established in April 2024 by the German Research Foundation (DFG). The focus is to understand better the function of ion channels and transporters, as well as their role in health and disease. We are an interdisciplinary team of 26 scientists from 11 countries who embarked on this exciting research journey.

\paragraph{The gatekeepers of the cell.}
All cells in your body are surrounded by lipid membranes that provide a stable environment inside the cell, which is crucial for cellular function and biochemistry. However, many biological compounds such as water, ions (Na+, K+, Cl- etc.) and polar molecules cannot cross the lipid membrane, and therefore need to be transported across this barrier with the help of proteins. Like carrying a bag of groceries from the supermarket, proteins called "transporters" slowly carry specific compounds (e.g. glucose) across the lipid membrane. These transporters are crucial for the uptake of food components in your gastrointestinal tract and are essential for growth, while also helping to clear potentially harmful compounds from your body fluids. Another protein class is ``ion channels'' that enable small ions to pass through membranes. These proteins form pores in the lipid membranes, forming a gate. Very much like a door, these gates open and close, thereby allowing the rapid movement of ions across the membrane barrier. These ion channels are truly great! Whenever charged ions (e.g. Na+) pass through ion channels, a small electric signal is generated. These signals are the basis of your entire physiology! Every time you think, speak, see, smell, taste, touch, move, breath and pretty much do anything, involved ion channels will generate electric signals that result in a physiological effect.

Here we would like to bring ion channels and transporters to your kitchen! Our scientists have selected some of their favorite recipes, not only based on flavor but also on how they are related to their research! Explore our recipes and see how science comes to life through cooking!

\recipe[This simple satisfying recipe is an example of the interplay between taste receptors, signaling pathways and ion channels that shapes flavor perception.
%My research focuses on the physiological properties of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), a key player in sodium transport in our bodies.
%And this recipe highlights the broader context in which ENaC operates.
%In this recipe, the interplay between the sweetness of the onions and potatoes, the umami of the chicken, the saltiness of the rice and broth, and the acidity of the lemon juice creates a harmonious balance that enhances the overall taste experience and demonstrates the complex interplay of factors that contribute to our overall taste experience.
The onions and potatoes sweetness is primarily perceived through the T1R2/T1R3 receptor, while the chicken's umami is detected through the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1). The balancing acidity of the lemon juice is sensed by sour taste ion-channel receptors (OTOP1). Last but not least, the saltiness of the rice and broth is sensed by the epithelial sodium channel ion channel, which is involved in sodium sensing in taste buds. The interaction between these different taste pathways contributes to the dish's overall flavor profile, highlighting the intricate mechanisms involved in taste perception.]

1 tbsp. Dried oregano
1 pinch Chili flakes (to taste)
1 tsp. Sea salt
1-3 pieces Pickled roasted red peppers in vinegar (e.g. “Roter Paprika geröstet” by Dittmann)
1-2 tbsp. Whole unpeeled almonds
Large amount Olive oil

% \textbf{For the Papas arrugadas}:

\method
\textbf{Prepare the Mojo Rojo Sauce}: Add garlic, all herbs, chili and salt to a tall measuring jug. Cover with half of the pickled red peppers. You can include a bit of the vinegar, but it shouldn't be too much. Add the almonds and cover with the remaining pickled red bell pepper. Add olive oil until the ingredients are almost covered. Homogenize with a kitchen blender. If there is too much oil, the sauce will be too dilute - thus, start with a small volume and add more later if necessary. Place the sauce in jars and store in the fridge for a few weeks.
\end{step}

\begin{step}
A few Small unpeeled potatoes 
1 l. Water
Scary amount Sea salt

\method
\textbf{Papas arrugadas}: Cook the unpeeled potatoes for 20-30 min. in water containing sea salt. A scary amount of salt must be added, until the potatoes are floating in the water (mimicing sea water)! After boiling, the potatoes will become wrinkly (“arrugada”). Discard the water and let the potatoes dry in the hot pot. A salt crust will form around the potatoes.

\textbf{Assemble the dish}: Serve the potatoes with the sauce and enjoy!
